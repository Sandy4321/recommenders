# Introduction

This project is a collection of the implementation of well-known recommendation algorithms and techniques that is currently documented in several publications. 

Most of the code has been programmed with Java 8 and kotlin. We took advantage of many useful features of the language, such as the use of lambda functions, Stream's and facilities for automatic parallelization of the code. 

The publicly available version of this project includes implementations of several recommendation algorithms. The modules published to date are the following:

- 2d Factorization Machines for recommender systems optimized using BPR criterion.
- item-kNN (Similarities: Cosine, Binary Cosine, Pearson Correlation, Jaccard Coefficient)
- user-kNN (Similarities: Cosine, Binary Cosine, Pearson Correlation, Jaccard Coefficient)
- item-kNN-TD (Similarities: Cosine, Binary Cosine)
- user-kNN-TD (Similarities: Binary Cosine)
- timeSVD (adapted for top@N recommendation)
- BPRMF
- Biased Matrix Factorization
- WRMF
- WRMF with side information
- Soft Margin Ranking Matrix Factorization
- Soft Margin Ranking Matrix Factorization side information
- TimePOP - Temporal Popularity baseline
